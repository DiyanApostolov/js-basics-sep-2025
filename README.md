## 💡 Tips for Success

### 🔍 Reading the Code

1. **Start with the function name** - it tells you what the program does
2. **Look at the parameters** - understand what inputs the function expects
3. **Follow the logic step by step** - trace through each line of code
4. **Check the test cases** - see what outputs are expected

### 🧪 Testing Your Understanding

1. **Run the code** with the provided test cases
2. **Modify the inputs** and see how the output changes
3. **Try to predict** the output before running
4. **Experiment** with different values

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check your syntax** - missing semicolons, brackets, or quotes
2. **Verify your file path** - make sure you're in the correct directory
3. **Read error messages carefully** - they usually tell you what's wrong
4. **Ask questions** - don't hesitate to reach out for help
